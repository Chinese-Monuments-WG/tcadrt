"000001","Anchan Monastery is located on Anchansi Street, Taigu County (縣城內安禪寺街). Song and Ming dynasties. It is one of the historical and cultural sites protected at the provincial level. 
The date of origin is unknown. According to textual sources, it was rebuilt during the Song dynasty and renovated in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, as well as the third year of the Qing Guangxu reign period (1877). The site occupies a total area of over 200 m2 and has a north-south orientation, facing south. The monastery is destroyed and the only extant structures are the sutra repository (藏经殿) and the main hall (正殿); both of which are axial buildings. While the former is a Song dynasty remnant, the latter was built in the Ming dynasty.

Occupying a total area of 2,750 m2, the site has a north-south orientation, facing south, and a three-courtyard configuration. The extant buildings on the central axis include the Mountain Gate, Hall of the Three Transcendents, main hall, and back hall. On the two sides are the lobe towers, the monks’ towers, galleries, and ear halls. The main structure of the current main hall is an artifact of the Jin dynasty, while the back hall and the Sanxian Hall (三仙殿) were rebuilt during the Ming and Qing dynasties. There are 2 Song steles, 3 steles documenting repairs of the Republican Period, and contains approximately 52 m2 of murals.
